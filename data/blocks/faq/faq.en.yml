questions:
  - question: Is a plan of an apartment from a developer or BTI enough to get started?
    answer: !markdown |
      No. The developer does not measure what he has built and does not provide drawings in electronic form for use in computer programs.

      Usually, a floor plan is issued on paper or a pdf file with partial dimensions.
  - question: How does the work begin?
    answer: !markdown |
      To get started, you need a dimensional drawing of the room in dwg or dxf format. Design is carried out in AutoCAD.
        
      Choose from three options for creating a drawing:

        1. **Free option** - use our editor <a href="https://clearline.com.ua/new/cad" target="_blank"> СlearlineСAD </a>,

          You can also use AutoCAD, ArchiCAD and other CAD programs, create a drawing and send us an email **obmer@clearline.com.ua**.
        2. **Take measurements and send them to us in any form** (freehand drawing, photo, pdf, etc.) We will transfer these dimensions into a computer program, the cost of transferring to an electronic form is 4.5 UAH. for 1 sq. meter with a minimum cost of work 450 UAH.
        3. **Order room measurement**. The cost of the work is 9 UAH. for 1 sq. meter with a minimum check-out amount of 900 UAH.
  - question: Project completion time?
    answer: !markdown |
      Average project completion time is 2 weeks. But the timing also depends on the speed of coordination of all design stages, everything is individual.
  - question: How do you pay?
    answer: !markdown |
      Payment is made in stages. First, you pay for the measurement or transfer of your measurements to electronic form. Then at the first meeting - an advance payment for the project - 50%, before the development of electrics - the rest.
  - question: Do you work with a designer in the office or remotely?
    answer: !markdown |
      We work in the office or online. We do a lot of projects remotely for customers from different cities.
  - question: Is it possible to make a design project in 3D?
    answer: !markdown |
      Yes, we do such projects. The arrangement of furniture and redevelopment is carried out in a three-dimensional model as clearly as possible.

      As a result, you receive a project with all the drawings for the renovation (including wall sweeps and isometry) and a link to a 3D model of your apartment, which you can use at any time.
  - question: We need a quick electrician, can we start with her?
    answer: !markdown |
      No, the electrician is the second part of the project. First, the redevelopment and arrangement of furniture is approved, and only then sockets, switches, lights, etc. are designed.
  - question: We have ideas, will they be considered in the design?
    answer: !markdown |
      Yes, before starting the design we send you a questionnaire, in which you express your wishes.

      Before the first meeting, we study them and offer our own version of redevelopment and furniture placement.

      Further, at a meeting with the designer, any other options are worked out. We work until the desired result is obtained.
  - question: Will you advise us in the choice of colors and materials?
    answer: !markdown |
      Yes, we provide a service of concept selection by colors and materials for the main surfaces.

      The consultation takes place in the office with an experienced designer - decorator. The result is fixed by a selection of images and color numbers from international palettes.
  - question: What should you have with you for consultation on the selection of colors and materials?
    answer: !markdown |
      At the meeting, a plan for the arrangement of furniture will be needed and if something of the materials has already been purchased or determined, it is advisable to provide photographs.
  - question: Will the designer help to determine the style and what is needed for this?
    answer: !markdown |
      If you have a selection of inspiring photos, please bring them to the meeting. If not, then it's okay, we'll find out everything at the consultation.
  - question: What will I have in the end of the consultation?
    answer: !markdown |
      During the meeting, the designer will form a letter with a list of the main interior elements with the assignment of textures and clarification of the numbering from the NCS and RAL color palettes.

      The letter will be accompanied by images, which later will be convenient for you to rely on when choosing materials. At the end of the meeting, an email is sent to you.
  - question: Can a designer help in choosing colors if part of the renovation has already been done?
    answer: !markdown |
      Yes, the designer offers the best color matching solutions taking into account existing surfaces and materials.
  - question: What do you need to create a 3D visualization?
    answer: !markdown |
      You will need room drawings in dwg format with an approved furniture arrangement plan and possible redevelopment.

      You also need to define combinations of colors and textures for the main surfaces, using the international palettes ncs, ral. and etc.

      You can draw up a technical task for visualization yourself or take advantage of the designer's consultation on the selection of colors and textures.
